# Introduction

The System Dynamics for Data Sciences (SD4DS) collection of exercises provides a set of skill building exercises for running and analyzing system dynamics computer simulation models using the Case Western Reserve University's (CWRU) High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster.  Each exercise is organized as a GitHub repository that can be cloned on users' local directory on the HPC with worked examples, sample code, and system dynamics models. 

# Basics

Each exercise is organized as a GitHub repository. Each exercise provides an overview, step-by-step instructions, links to YouTube videos demonstrating the steps for replicating the exercises, and any additional resources. Since many tasks can be easily accomplished in R or Python, whenever possible, examples of both are provided.
